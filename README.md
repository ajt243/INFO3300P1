This project explores the sex distribution of Grammy Award winners in the top four categories: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist. By analyzing data from 1959 to the present, we examine the historical trends of male, female, and mixed-sex group winners, focusing on the evolving representation of women in these prestigious awards. Through our visualizations, we aim to highlight the sex disparities in the music industry and provide insights into how female artists have increasingly gained recognition in recent years, sparking a conversation about equity and diversity in the Grammy Awards.
